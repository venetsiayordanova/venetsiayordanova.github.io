                      Ever wondered how common your birthday is?  What do you think is the most popular month to be born?  What about the most popular day of the week?  Why?
                      Courtesy of the CDC: Vital Statistics of the United States – Volume 1, Natality (1994-2003), we can visualize it.
                      By a slim margin, Tuesday is the most popular day of the week to be born (Saturday and Sunday are the least).  Summer is the most common season to be born (we can imagine why, especially if there’s a colder winter forcing people to stay inside…).
                      It’s relatively interesting to see that along with weekends, December 24th and 25th, January 1st, and July 4th are the least common days to be born. After all, they are American holidays…

                      Several ancient cultures, including the Egyptians and Chinese, practiced chromotherapy, or the use of colors to heal. Chromotherapy is sometimes referred to as light therapy or colorology and is still used today as a holistic or alternative treatment.
                      In this treatment:
                      Red was used to stimulate the body and mind and to increase circulation.
                      Yellow was thought to stimulate the nerves and purify the body.
                      Orange was used to heal the lungs and to increase energy levels.
                      Blue was believed to soothe illnesses and treat pain.
                      Indigo shades were thought to alleviate skin problems.
